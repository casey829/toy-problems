**Speed Detector **
This JavaScript program takes the speed of a car as input and calculates demerit points based on the specified criteria. It then prints the appropriate message according to the number of demerit points.
GUIDES
The program defines a function speedDetector that calculates demerit points based on the input speed and a predefined speed limit.
The points function takes the input speed, calls  speedDetector, and logs the appropriate message based on the demerit points.
Example :
If the speed is less than 70 km/h, it prints: "Ok".
If the speed is greater than or equal to 70 km/h, it calculates and prints the demerit points.
If the demerit points exceed 12, it prints: "License suspended".
